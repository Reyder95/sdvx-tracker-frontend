## Introduction
This is a project developed for use with the game SOUND VOLTEX and its respective simulators (Unnamed SDVX Clone, K-Shoot Mania, and soon Neurosonic). In a tl;dr fashion, it will be a system that users can keep track of all their scores among these versions of the game and view statistics that may make them better players. Since there are many versions of the game and people switch it up, having one central system where you can manually input and keep track of scores would be a benefit. This system will also support customs for the various simulators (as you enter charts in on your own)

## Upcoming Feature List
### Song Entry
At the current moment, there is a plan to allow for users to manually input songs into a global song listing. This global song listing can be viewed by all players, and it will be the start of allowing the website to keep a huge collection of official and custom chart information to be used by all players. But there are a few problems that need to be discussed.
1. Can't lots of people input the same chart over and over again without checking if one exists?
    * Yes, and our solution to this is the Verified system. While users may still be to continually duplicate charts, verified ensures that all charts placed in there are unique from one another. Verified charts will only allow for official charts to be implemented (no customs)
    * There will eventually be a system to limit the number of duplicates via algorithms to figure out whether or not a specific chart is a duplicate of an existing one or not, however this will primarily check against Verified since non-verified charts may have errors.
2. Who can edit the information in a chart I upload?
    * At the current moment, only you and the moderators / developers will have the ability to edit your chart information. However, in the future, we will handle the system in a "wiki" fashion, and only Verified charts will be unable to edit.
3. How does a chart get verified?
    * A chart will need a specific number of player and moderator votes in order to be verifiable. This is still being discussed, but the numbers aren't finalized. Somewhere around 3 to 5 players and 1 or 2 moderators will be required for the verification of a specific chart.
4. What if I post a score on one version of an unverified chart, but another chart becomes verified?
    * We will be adding a score transferring system. So you can simply take the scores on one chart and transfer them to another. Considering there is no global leaderboards and you will not be competing against others, even people who abuse this in any way will not be gaining anything from it.
